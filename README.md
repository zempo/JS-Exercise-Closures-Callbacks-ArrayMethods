# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript

## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your tests are passing.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).

**In JavaScript, closure happens when a function cannot find a variable or callback function called within its local scope - anywhere within its curly braces.**
**Thus, in order to execute the code within its scope, the compiler will look for the variable or function outside the function scope.**
**Closure can only happen with variables and functions outside of the function - at the global scope or with parent functions the function in question might be nested in.**

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name) {
  return function () {
    // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`);
  };
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");

dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

**Closure is used on the last bracket of the return of an anonymous function in personalDice. In order for the anonymous function to log to the console, it needs to look outside its scope for the name parameter.**

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?
**In both instances, the name 'Dan' stays the same. The arguement 'Dan' is consistent. However, the roll could change because it is reinitialized and redefined each call.**

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`?

**The lexical scope of newRoll is the Math.random() method.**

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function () {
  var a = (b = 3);
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== "undefined"));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== "undefined"));
```

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```

3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a pull request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your Team Lead as a reviewer on the pull request
- [ ] Your Team Lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master
